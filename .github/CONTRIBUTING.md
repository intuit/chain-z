# How to contribute ?

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

- Fork the repository
- All code should be documented and in a pull-request (new or existing), make sure your commit comments are clean.
- Ensure the pull request title has a readable name for the feature being added, removed, deprecated or fixed
- Submit a pull request to master branch and pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days and comments will be added
- If there are comments to address, apply your changes in a separate commit and push that to your feature branch and then approval will be done accordingly
